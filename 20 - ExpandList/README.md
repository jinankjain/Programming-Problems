Problem Statement: You have to complete a function expandList which reads a list, lst, of n integer as argument. Let's represent lst=[a0,a1,…an−1]. It has to return a new list, b. List b will of length m(=∑n−1i=0ai) and consist elements from original list, lst, in following format.

b=[a0,a0,…a0 times, a1,a1,…a1 times,…,an−1,an−1,…an−1 times]

For example, if lst is [2, 3, 1, 4], then you should return array b = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Sample

	Input

	[2,3,1,4]

	Output

	[2,2,3,3,3,1,4,4,4,4]
