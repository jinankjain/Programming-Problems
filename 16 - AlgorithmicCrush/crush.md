Problem Statement:Devendra is on cloud nine after seeing his crush smiling at him in class. At that very moment his professor singles him out and asks him a question. Devendra’s mind is all too fuzzy with his crush and her smile to concentrate on anything else. Help him solve the problem :

You are given a list of size N, initialized with zeroes. You have to perform M queries on the list and output the maximum of final values of all the N elements in the list. For every query, you are given three integers a, b and k and you have to add value k to all the elements ranging from index a to b(both inclusive).

Input Format
First line will contain two integers N and M separated by a single space.
Next M lines will contain three integers a, b and k separated by a single space.
Numbers in list are numbered from 1 to N.

Output Format
A single line containing maximum value in the final list.

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 107
1 ≤ M ≤ 2 * 105
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ N
0 ≤ k ≤ 109
